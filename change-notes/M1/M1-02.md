# M1-02: Backend Jira OAuth flow
- Implemented OAuth start/callback with scope validation and Atlassian resource lookup.
- Added encrypted token storage (AES-256-GCM) in Postgres via Prisma models `User` and `JiraConnection`.
- Added helpers for Prisma client and encryption; updated env loading to read root `.env`.
- Adjusted required scopes to match Atlassian 3LO catalog: `offline_access`, `read:jira-user`, `read:jira-work`.
- Fix: OAuth 500 due to `ENCRYPTION_KEY` not being read in the dev workspace. Cause: encryption helper cached env before `.env` loaded; Solution: load key at call-time and normalize env loading paths. Result: OAuth completes successfully.
